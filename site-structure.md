## 🧱 SITE STRUCTURE (Recommended)

Think of your site as an information hub. Here's a structure that balances UX and SEO:

### 1. **Homepage**
- Quick intro: “Your guide to all things parquet – styles, installation tips, maintenance tricks, and more.”
- Highlight categories: Link to your main content pillars.
- Maybe a featured article or top DIY tip.
- Add a clear note that this is a guide site, not a shop.

---

### 2. **Main Categories (Your Content Pillars)**
These should match common search themes and user intent:

| Category | Description | Example Articles |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Types of Parquet** | Explain different styles, materials, and looks | “Laminate vs. Engineered Parquet”, “What is Chevron Parquet?” |
| **Installation & DIY** | Help readers install or prep for professionals | “How to Install Laminate Parquet”, “What to Know Before Installing Parquet Over Tiles” |
| **Maintenance & Cleaning** | Keep the floor beautiful | “Best Products for Parquet Cleaning”, “Can You Use Steam Mop on Parquet?” |
| **Trends & Inspiration** | Interior design ideas, modern looks | “Parquet Trends in 2025”, “Scandinavian Style with Light Oak Parquet” |
| **Price & Buying Guide** | Cost breakdowns, brand comparisons | “How Much Does Parquet Cost in Turkey?”, “Best Parquet Brands in 2025” |

Add **tags** within each article like: “oak,” “budget,” “waterproof,” “DIY,” etc.

---

### 3. **Other Pages**
- **About**: Brief note on who you are and why you made the site.
- **Contact**: In case brands or contractors want to collaborate.
- **Glossary** *(optional)*: Define jargon like “Herringbone,” “Floating floor,” “Underlayment,” etc.
- **Tools / Calculators** *(future idea)*: Parquet size estimator, cost calculator, etc.

## 🎯 CONTENT STRATEGY

### ✅ Step 1: Cover the Basics (Foundational Content)
Create ~10 solid posts that answer common parquet questions. This builds trust + authority.

Examples:
- “What is Parquet Flooring?”
- “How to Choose the Right Parquet for Your Home”
- “Parquet vs Hardwood: Key Differences”
- “Can You Use Parquet in Bathrooms?”

> These should be beginner-friendly, well-structured, and evergreen.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Go Long-Tail (SEO goldmine)
Target ultra-specific searches that bigger sites ignore.

Examples:
- “How to fix squeaky parquet floors without removing them”
- “Parquet installation cost in Istanbul 2025”
- “Best parquet for underfloor heating systems”

---

### ✅ Step 3: Add Visual + Tool-based Content
Break up walls of text with:
- Infographics (e.g., “Types of Parquet Patterns”)
- Comparison tables (e.g., “Brand A vs Brand B”)
- Step-by-step diagrams
- DIY photo guides
- Interactive calculators (later)

---

### ✅ Step 4: Internal Linking
Make sure every article links to related ones. For example:
> In “How to Clean Parquet,” you can link to:
> - “Top 5 Cleaning Products for Parquet”
> - “Can I Use a Steam Mop on Laminate?”

---

### ✅ Step 5: Think Monetization Early
Start tagging content that could be monetized later with affiliate links or sponsored mentions, e.g.:
- “Top 5 Parquet Brands in Turkey”
- “Where to Buy Parquet Online in 2025”
